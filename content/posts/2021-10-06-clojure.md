I'm learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org) on the basis that you should learn something that will change your way of thinking. I've previously stuck to C-family languages, and I work professionally with Java.

To do this I'm working through [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://nostarch.com/clojure), which has a good balance of whimsy (it's not so dry as other technical books) and exercises vs plain reading material.

I'm planning to build a slack clone using full-stack clojure, since I learn faster if I get stuck in and try something.
