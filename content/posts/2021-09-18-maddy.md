Since my [last post on mail servers](https://mfashby.net/posts/2018-06-01-mailu/), the [maddy](https://maddy.email/) email server has advanced significantly, and now includes enough functionality to be a useful mail server adhering to current best practices. This includes DKIM, spam filtering with rspamd, virtual user management and more.

I'm running this in conjunction with [alps](https://sr.ht/~migadu/alps/) webmail on my raspberry pi, and it's working well.

I'm not yet using this as my daily driver account, but I might do in future.
