I found [plainoldrecipe](https://github.com/poundifdef/plainoldrecipe) a while back, I find it really handy for some recipe sites which are full of cookie banners and ads, it makes them much easier to read on a phone or small laptop while I'm actually trying to cook. 

I'm hosting it myself [here](https://recipe.mfashby.net) as the author's site is sometimes down.

A cool extension might be some way to send the recipe to my kindle for easier reading & offline usage.
