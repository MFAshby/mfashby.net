Since my last post on longboarding, I've been learning to [push up slide](https://downhill254.com/how-to-push-up-slide-longboarding/) and [coleman slide](https://downhill254.com/coleman-slide-for-longboard-downhill-pendulum-slide/). These are essential skills to control your speed so you can safely tackle steeper and longer hills.

I've also made a couple of hardware changes
- switched to [powell peralta snakes](https://newtons-shred.co.uk/shop/skateboards/wheels/cruiser-filmer/powell-peralta-snakes-red-66mm-75a/), following many many reviews on [reddit](https://teddit.net/r/longboarding)
- added [freebrake brake soles](https://newtons-shred.co.uk/shop/safety/other/footbraking-sole/freebrake-longboard-skateboard-footbraking-sole-4mm-pair/) to my shoes. I had nearly worn through the heel and toe on my right foot from frequent braking. These appear to be up-cycled car tyres!

Pictures and videos to follow.
