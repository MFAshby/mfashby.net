I'm intending this site to be a mix of personal tech projects & writing about stuff in my life. 

This site is currently built with [Jekyll][jekyll], and served using [nginx][nginx] from my [Raspberry Pi Model 2B][rpi-2b]. I'm currently editing it with [VS Code][vscode].

The same Raspberry also hosts [my wife's blog][heyworlditshenry], where she writes about our son Henry, who sadly passed away shortly after he was born.

I've got a few personal projects active at the moment, and I hope to write about all of them!
