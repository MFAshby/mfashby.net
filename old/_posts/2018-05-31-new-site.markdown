I'm intending to write more online about the stuff I tinker with. 

You can expect posts about 
* what I do with my [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), 
* websites and servers that I run including [my wife's blog](https://heyworlditshenry.com) and my [email server](https://mail.mfashby.net) 
* more physical projects like getting a [RepRap](https://reprap.org/) up and running
